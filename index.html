      <h2>Spring, 2022</h2>
      <h2>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</h2>
      <p class = "introtext">
        In this special first-of-its-kind elective, students explored the boundaries of virtual reality and the human body.
        Topics included brain-computer interfaces with virtual reality, haptic technologies, and other senses.
        Guest lecturers were experts in both academia and industry.
        Students learned how to make virtual reality experiences in the game engine Unity, and the semester culminated with a demos of
         new product/service which were presented to an audience of distinguished guests/investors/partners.

            Aware is a virtual reality (VR) experience that aims to help people who struggle with
            big emotions improve their coping skills and interoception. Individuals will use

            corresponding to emotion-associated symptoms in the body. Users will engage in a
            de-escalation environment that includes a calming scene and accessibility preferences
            and will be guided through preferred coping strategies (for eg. box breathing). Our vision
            is for this VR experience to serve as a guide to emotional regulation and a documentation
            tool that tracks the success of coping techniques for a person.

            about spacecraft systems engineering, a fundamental concept in aerospace engineering. In our

            the parts of the rover and understand the systems engineering process behind the rover’s
            design. Students will have the ability to operate the rover on Mars, mimicking operations in real
            life, and later features will allow the student to control the robotic sampling drill to collect rock

            and applications of aerospace engineering through a series of challenges involving air and
            space. Other modules will have features such as analyzing and flying a jet plane, exploring the
            surface of Mars using remote controlled and autonomous vehicles, and conducting operations in
            the International Space Station (ISS). Through these challenges, students will learn
            fundamental concepts in aerospace engineering such as aerodynamics, systems engineering,
            and flight dynamics. This first iteration of the subject will include only VR applications, using the
            Meta Quest 2 headset. The Aeroverse course hopes to collect data regarding the impact of VR
            as a teaching medium and to quantify the effect it has on students’ learning outcomes.

            Virtual Vitality is a VR-gamified physical therapy tool that helps stroke patients
            regain their finger movement abilities. The game uses Meta Quest’s built-in hand motion
            capture to show users’ hands in different VR environments, where physiotherapy is
            turned into a music game in which users pinch their fingers in response to objects
            popping up on their individual fingers and creating a melody.

            In our team, there is a member coping with ACL injuries, and two of us are
            managing scoliosis. Motivated by the challenges we faced during our own physical
            therapy journeys, we came together to create Virtual Vitality. Drawing from our personal
            experiences, our objective is to enhance the physical therapy journey for individuals,
            ensuring a more positive and effective long-term experience for a broader audience.

            Our team has identified 2 main limitations in conventional physiotherapy practices:
            <ol class = "introtext">
              <li>Monotonous and repetitive approaches
              <li>Progress takes time, and the long-term commitment often makes
                patients feel defeated or lack motivation over time
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p class = "projecttext">
            Reflecting on those observations, we decided that this would be an excellent
            concept to implement in Virtual Reality/Extended Reality as its high potential to increase
            interactivity could be beneficial to leverage. While a lot of hospitals and clinics have
            been trying to incorporate entertainment into their rehabilitation programs, a lot of
            them are just providing TV screens for patients to distract themselves while they carry out
            their rehab exercises, resulting in a single-way input of entertainment for them.

            Building up on that lack of intractability, our project creates a two-way
            communication where patients can look at the soothing landscape in their headset and
            listen to the music and at the same time, jam and play along to the music. From our
            observations, we believe that entertainment is the most effective when the user is
            involved in the creation process, and in our case, users will be majorly involved in the
            music creation process. This will also help a lot with distracting patients from pain and
            the dull nature of physiotherapy.

            Left for Bread is a multiplayer horror game with a comedic element embedded into the
            experience. Setting it aside from the classic horror genre is the comedic intent: being
            chased by a loaf of bread provides an interesting contrast to the typical
            run-from-monster archetype. There are five playable characters, namely flour, eggs,
            salt, water, and the baguette. The baguette seeks to hunt down the ingredient players
            as the game begins to become stronger; to take down the baker who neglected the
            oven, the baguette requires the ingredients from which it can extract strength.

            Video games and entertainment are one of the most common applications for VR,
            but narrative games are still one of the more underdeveloped genres. Similar to
            how the game Before Your Eyes was “revolutionary” in its way of having its
            player interact with the game via another modality (eyetracking), our game set out
            to have another unique modality for the player to use (sitting and standing). As
            the capabilities of virtual reality continue to grow, the prospect of a player using
            an otherwise ordinary action to interact with a game becomes more possible.
            Our exploration of sitting/standing as a mechanic within a
            storytelling game may prove to be significant in the future as something that
            hasn’t yet been done before by other games.

            "Cosmic Cube Crush" is a virtual reality

            Placing players inside a 3D cube universe, the game challenges users to manipulate the universe

            environment, such as a warm, cozy kitchen top, the space-time continuum, or colorful galaxies.
            Our hope is to introduce a new conceptual game to the VR user base and is designed for all ages.

            Imagine a world where conquering phobias is an empowering and gamified experience.
            Our project pioneers Extended Reality (XR) therapy for phobias, addressing the spectrum
            from mild discomfort to paralyzing panic attacks. XR uniquely allows users' agency to
            control their experiences, with a safety net to halt virtual fear at any moment. Focusing
            initially on Trypophobia (fear of holes), we creatively manipulate and gamify the
            experience, incentivizing users with virtual rewards.
